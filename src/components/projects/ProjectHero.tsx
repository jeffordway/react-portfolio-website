          Ever since writing my first line of code, I've persevered through
          countless hours of hard work and dedication to become a proficient
          full-stack developer. Along this journey, I have gained experience
          with various languages and frameworks, including JavaScript,
          Typescript, React, HTML, CSS, Ajax, JSON, MySQL, MongoDB, Tailwind,
          Bootstrap, and Figma.
